  <!-- 
    [ngClass] is a way to add one or multiple classses to an element based of the value of a variable. 
    In this case we use the variable called class to change styles based on how many bikes are available.
    
    The {{}} syntax is used to "print" the value of a variable to the dom as text.
   -->
  <span class="State" [ngClass]="class">Available: {{availableCount}}</span>
