# Rentabike

This small demo project was created as part of an assignment for the Development enviorment class at Copenhagen school og buisness and technology (KEA).

The assignemt requred us to analyze different frontend frameworks, and create a demo in the framework we ended up choosing. 
This repo is a response to the part of the assignment stating: 
> Produce a description of how the framework carries out some core functions â€“ I want you to show me that you can explain how the framework actually does its job
